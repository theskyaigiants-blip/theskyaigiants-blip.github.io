          <h3>1. Cloud Strategy & Architecture</h3>
          <p>
            We work with your leadership and engineers to define a cloud strategy aligned with business goals — including target architecture diagrams, security posture, migration approach, and cost model.
            Deliverables include reference architecture, runbooks, and a phased migration plan.

          <p>
            Rehost, replatform or refactor applications for cloud. We perform dependency mapping, data replication planning, cutover design and performance testing to minimize downtime.
            Special focus on data consistency, DB replication and transactional integrity during migration.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Outcomes:</strong> reduced ops overhead, easier scaling and improved deployment velocity.</p>

          <p>
            We implement IaC (Terraform, Pulumi, CloudFormation) for reproducible environments and GitOps workflows for safe infrastructure changes.
            Automation reduces human errors and enables consistent multi-environment deployments (dev/stage/prod).

          <p>
            Security-first design: identity & access management, network segmentation, secret management, encryption, logging and SIEM integration.
            We help clients meet regulatory compliance such as SOC2, ISO27001, GDPR, and industry-specific controls.

          <p>
            We analyze usage patterns, recommend right-sizing, pricing models and reserved/spot strategies to reduce cloud spend.
            Our FinOps playbooks ensure cost visibility and actionable recommendations to engineering teams.
